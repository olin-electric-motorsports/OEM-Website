    title: "About Us"
    body: Olin Electric Motorsports is an undergraduate project team at Olin College of
          Engineering focused on educating engineers through developing and manufacturing
          electric race cars. Electric vehicles provide a platform for our team to pursue
          in-depth mechanical, electrical, computer, and systems engineering. By working 
          together to compete each season, members develop their technical knowledge as
          well as communication and leadership skills essential for success as a professional
          engineer.<br><br><img src="assets/img/team-photos/oem-team-photo-fall-2021.png" width=100%>
