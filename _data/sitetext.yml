    title: "About Us"
    body: Olin Electric Motorsports is an undergraduate project team at Olin College of
          Engineering focused on educating engineers through developing and manufacturing
          electric race cars. Electric vehicles provide a platform for our team to pursue
          in-depth mechanical, electrical, computer, and systems engineering. By working 
          together to compete each season,  s develop their technical knowledge as
          well as communication and leadership skills essential for success as a professional
          engineer.<br><br><img src="assets/img/team-photos/meeting_team_photo_2025.jpg" width=100%>

    title: "Support Us"
    body: "This year is a turning point for our team. Having successfully designed, built, and competed in the
      Formula SAE competition in Michigan for the past two cycles, we are pushing ourselves to elevate our engineering
      by embracing a data-driven design philosophy. This strategic shift is in direct response to feedback from FSAE
      design judges last year, who emphasized the importance of setting concrete performance goals and validating designs
      with empirical data.
      \n


      Our primary objective for the current design cycle is to develop a vehicle capable of completing the endurance event
      in under 30 minutes. To achieve this ambitious target, we are pursuing two significant technical advancements: the
      integration of a more advanced data acquisition system and the development of our teamâ€™s first-ever aerodynamics package.
      To get this data, we are integrating over ten new sensors into our car, including wheel speed sensors, suspension strain gauges,
      and infrared tire temperature sensors. This data is the key to creating and validating a full-vehicle suspension simulation
      in MATLAB and an aerodynamic model. For the first time, these models will allow us to define our suspension geometry and new
      aerodynamics package with test data, marking our transition from theory-based to data-driven engineering.
      \n


      To ensure we can meet these incredible goals we are launching a fundraising campaign with the goal of raising $20,000 by Nov 14.
      All funds will go directly toward the materials for our composite work that will give our  s a hands-on learning experience they 
      simply would not have otherwise. The funds will also contribute to our new suite of sensors, allowing us to rigorously test and advance 
      our car through data. To learn more about our journey and how you can support us, visit the fundraiser here"
