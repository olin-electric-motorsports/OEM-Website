  about:
    title: "About Us"
    body: Olin Electric Motorsports is an undergraduate project team at Olin College of
          Engineering focused on educating engineers through developing and manufacturing
          electric race cars. Electric vehicles provide a platform for our team to pursue
          in-depth mechanical, electrical, computer, and systems engineering. By working 
          together to compete each season, members develop their technical knowledge as
          well as communication and leadership skills essential for success as a professional
          engineer.<br><br><img src="assets/img/team-photos/oem-team-photo-spring-2024.png" width=100%>

    title: "Support Us"
    body: "This year marks a significant milestone for our team—the first time in over five years 
      that we have a fully functional and drivable car, the Mk VI. But it’s more than just a vehicle; 
      it represents our journey of resilience, commitment, and growth. To ensure we keep Mk VI on the road, 
      we’re launching a fundraising campaign with a goal of raising $10,000 by November 6th. 
      The funds will support the purchase of a new motor, motor controller, and other essential components, 
      enabling us to continue gathering vital testing data that will inform the design of our next car, Mk VII.
      \n


      Maintaining Mk VI is not just about keeping a car running; it’s about sustaining the momentum that drives 
      our team forward. After years of repurposing components from past models, this funding will allow us to 
      preserve the integrity and functionality of Mk VI. It will provide us with the opportunity to deepen our 
      learning from the data we collect and keep the team inspired as we work towards our ambitious goal of 
      building the next generation car within a year. To learn more about our journey and how you can support us, 
      visit our fundraiser here:"
